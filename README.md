## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and financial technology, with a strong commitment to open source and building meaningful technology.

In addition to hands-on development, I actively contribute to global tech communities. I've been involved in initiatives such as Meta Developer Circles, Google Developer Groups, Global AI Community, SheCodesVietnam, and GirlScriptIndia. These experiences have strengthened my ability to grow inclusive developer ecosystems and mentor emerging talent.

As a Web3 Developer Advocate, Iâ€™ve led ecosystem and DevRel efforts across APACâ€”speaking at events like BUIDL Vietnam 2023, ETH Vietnam 2022, and mentoring at Scaling Ethereum, ETH Tokyo, and ETH Taipei.

My current focus is on researching and building AI-powered and decentralized applications, merging cutting-edge innovation with real-world impact.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to software engineering opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
