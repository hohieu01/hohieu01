## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and financial technology, with a strong commitment to open source and building meaningful technology.

Besides coding, I'm interested in building tech communities. I contributed to various national and international tech initiatives including the Executive Member @Meta Developer Circle: Hanoi, Student Ambassador @Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors, DSC Lead @Google Developer Groups, Speaker @Global AI Community, Deputy Executive Lead @SheCodesVietnam, and Mentor @GirlScriptIndia. These experiences have enabled me to develop skills and gain knowledge in the tech industry while also helping me to create a thriving community that empowers individuals to enhance their technical and professional abilities.

As a blockchain developer advocate, I also executed a variety of ecosystem development and developer relations activities in the APAC region including speaking at BUIDL Vietnam 2023, ETH Vietnam 2022, and serving as a mentor at Scaling Ethereum 2023, ETH Tokyo 2023, and ETH Taipei 2023.

My current focus is on researching and building AI-powered and decentralized applications, merging cutting-edge innovation with real-world impact.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to software engineering opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
