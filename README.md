## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and financial technology, with a strong commitment to open source and building meaningful technology.

Besides coding, I'm interested in building tech communities. I have contributed to various national and international tech initiatives, including serving as a former Executive Member at Meta Developer Circle: Hanoi, former Student Ambassador at Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors, former DSC Lead at Google Developer Groups, former Speaker at Global AI Community, former Deputy Executive Lead at SheCodesVietnam, and former Mentor at GirlScriptIndia. These experiences have enabled me to develop skills and gain knowledge in the tech industry while also helping me to create a thriving community that empowers individuals to enhance their technical and professional abilities.

As a blockchain developer advocate, I also executed a variety of ecosystem development and developer relations activities in the APAC region including speaking at BUIDL Vietnam 2023, ETH Vietnam 2022, and serving as a mentor at Scaling Ethereum 2023, ETH Tokyo 2023, and ETH Taipei 2023.

My current focus is on researching and building AI-powered and decentralized applications, merging cutting-edge innovation with real-world impact.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to software engineering opportunities. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
